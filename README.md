# Sea-Level-Predictor

Overview:

This project involved analyzing the global average sea level change since 1880, with the aim to predict future sea levels using a linear regression model.

Features:

Plotted scatter plots of historical sea level data.
Used the linregress function from scipy.stats to predict sea level changes through 2050.
Generated two lines of best fit to compare past trends with future predictions.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
SciPy
